"""In-memory decode cache + CPU-side compositing for the fast thumbnail grid.

Mirrors ``data/slice_loader.py``'s byte-budgeted LRU + background-thread
request/callback pattern, but keyed by image path instead of ``(t, z)``,
and it also owns the CPU-side channel compositing math since this render
path has no GL context at all. Pure numpy: no Qt, no vispy -- colors are
flat RGB (picked via a plain color dialog, see
``widgets/thumbnail_colors_panel.py``), not gradient colormaps, so there's
no LUT/colormap-registry lookup needed here.

Delivery contract: ``callback(path)`` fires on the worker thread once
``path`` has been decoded into the cache -- Qt consumers must marshal to
the GUI thread themselves (same rule as ``ImageBuffer.subscribe`` /
``SliceLoader``).

    Each channel is normalized to ``[0, 1]`` by clim + gamma (same as the
    vispy path's shader), then blended onto an accumulating canvas
    (starting at black) in channel-index order:

    - ``additive``: ``canvas += color * t * opacity`` (matches the vispy
      path's default look -- channels brighten on top of each other).
    - ``overlay``: ``alpha = t * opacity; canvas = canvas*(1-alpha) +
      color*alpha`` -- data-driven alpha compositing, so a segmentation
      mask channel tints over whatever's already composited instead of
      just brightening it. Useful for eyeballing masks.

    Canvas is clipped to ``[0, 1]`` after every channel so overlay math
